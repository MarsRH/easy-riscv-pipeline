# 32-bit RISC-V Model with 5-Stage Pipeline

This project is a 32-bit RISC-V model developed on Quartus II 9.0. It implements a simple 5-stage pipeline functionality.

## Features

- 32-bit RISC-V architecture
- 5-stage pipeline:
    - Instruction Fetch (IF)
    - Instruction Decode (ID)
    - Execute (EX)
    - Memory Access (MEM)
    - Write Back (WB)
- Developed using Quartus II 9.0

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Quartus II 9.0 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/MarsRH/easy-riscv-pipeline.git
        ```
2. Open the project in Quartus II 9.0.

### Usage

1. Compile the project in Quartus II.
2. Program the FPGA with the compiled design.
3. Run the simulation to verify the pipeline functionality.
